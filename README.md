Run the `run-docker.sh` script to build and launch a Docker container with all dependencies.

Then, within the container, run `cd content && ./run-dexy.sh` to build all docs.

You only need [Docker](https://www.docker.io/) installed + a working internet
connection, everything else will be downloaded and installed in the container.

For more information see the [Dexy](http://dexy.it) website or get in touch with [@dexyit](http://twitter.com/dexyit).
